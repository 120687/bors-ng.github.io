This is your first of what should be many monthly bursts of new about bors-ng,
the bot that tests your code before it becomes the master.

In the [last month](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20closed%3A2017-01-01..2017-01-31),
I landed 32 PRs in the bors-ng repository.

### Notable Additions

- Created a [test harness for testing code that talks to GitHub](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/76)
- Added a way to [change the master branch from the Settings page](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/68)
- Added a way to [cancel pull requests after they're approved](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/63)
- Made bors [time out batches that take too long](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/62)
- Made the system for [adding and managing reviewers actually reasonable](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/16)
- Added an [administrator dashboard](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/pull/28)

### Who's using bors?

This month, I unilateraly decide to highlight [emberwatch/ember-language-server](https://github.com/emberwatch/ember-language-server). Language Servers are a type of plugin for VCCode, and the Ember Language Server uses this to provide deep integration between VSCode and the Ember client-side web framework.
