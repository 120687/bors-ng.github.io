Want to help out with writing TMIB but don't have write access to the repo?
[Go here](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng.github.io/blob/tmib-EDITION_NUMBER/_posts/EDITION_DATE-tmib-EDITION_NUMBER.md), then click the pencil button. That'll open a pull request for the in-progress edition of TMIB.

This Month in Bors checklist, for whoever's in charge of writing it:

- [ ] Fix the edition number and date at the top of the pull-request

- [ ] Update the issue number in the title area

- [ ] Update the month in the date area

- [ ] Update the month in the description area

- [ ] Update the URL in the "last month" PR link

- [ ] Update the PR count in the PR paragraph

- [ ] Generate the "notable additions" list

- [ ] Generate the "new contributors" list

- [ ] Find a new featured user

- [ ] Find a screenshot

And, this should be the last thing the writer does:

- [ ] Create, and link in, next month's PR, so that the published edition links to the next one
